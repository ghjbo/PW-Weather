Raspberry Pi Weather Station

The problem is I live where there is fog and sunshine for various times
thru out the week. So trying to water a large planter box for tomatos 
is a trial and error as it drains out the bottom in order to allow the
soil to breath.

So as a project to set up a solar powered weather station that would
monitor among other things soil mositure, and water as needed via drip
irrigation to minimize evaporation due to direct sunlight.

So Raspberry Pi + Battery + Solar charging system + Soil Moisture sensor and
associated A/D and power circuits required. Water control system (12V solenoid 
water valve, water pump(pond-5Psi?), plumbing. 

Those are the basics of the project however since I needed to add a A/D
anyway the MCP3008 has 8 channels and was easy to interface. So a weather
station should have the three parameters Temperture, Humidity, barometric
pressure, and air quality to round it out since we are in a large metro area.
